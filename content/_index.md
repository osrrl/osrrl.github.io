title: "SPAN581: Research Methods in Linguistics"
description: "In this course students will examine the fundamental principles 
of doing open and reproducible research in SLA, linguistics, and 
psycholinguistics. 
Specifically, the focus is on developing an in depth understanding of the 
most common experimental paradigms and procedures used in quantitative 
research. 
Additionally, students will learn details about the entire research process, 
from generating research questions, collecting and analyzing data, to writing
and submitting a scientific report. 
Students will develop a foundation in the most common tools at the disposal of 
todays data scientist (i.e. OSF, GitHub, Knitr, etc.). 
The procedures covered in this course will help beginning researchers assure 
the integrity of their data, as well as apply the general principles of 
transparency, reproducibility, and replicability--collectively known as open 
science--to their own work."
